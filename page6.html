<p><b>PRECAUTIONS: </b></p>
<p>We are dedicated to providing you the safest and best customer service even in this pandemic. Most of our locations opened from June and are now taking appointments everyday. You can book an appointment online through our website or give us a call in the salon so an representative will be able to assist you in making one. We are taking proper measures to make sure our salon is clean, sanitize and ready to be re-opened for business. Please check the measures we are adopting to help reduce the spread of virus.
</p> <br>
        <p><b>Sanitizing:</b></p> 
        <br>
        <ol type = "1">
            <li>All the salons are going with all the necessary requirements from the State Board of Cosmetology.</li>
            <li>Proper cleaning and disinfection of the salon every day.</li>
            <li>Each threading station is fully cleaned and disinfected before and after every client, including chairs, mirrors, spray bottles and more.</li> 
            <li>Salon properly equipped with necessary sanitizers at places of check-in, check out, front counter all threading stations.</li>
            <li>Proper signs displaying disinfected areas and notices regarding changes.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p><b>Conducting Service:</b></p>
        <br>
        <ol type = "1">
        <li>Unlike the past, where the threaders performed the service by holding the throat in their mouth, now we tie the thread around our neck. This way the thread isn’t infected and the ethicians can perform the service even with their mask on.</li>
        <li>Masks required for each and everyone entering the salon for service.</li>
        <li>We are only conducting small waxing services like underarms waxing, full arms and full legs.  We are not taking appointments for belly , back, bikini or full body waxing sessions.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p><b>Social Distancing:</b></p>
        <br>
        <ol type = "1">
        <li>We are practicing proper social distancing inside the salon. There will be limited number of threaders working in the salon, thus keeping 6-feet distance between each other.</li>
        <li>Only limited number of clients are allowed inside the store who would be asked to maintain  6-feet distance between one another.</li>
        <li>Clients may be asked to wait in their car if the stylist are not available during the time you arrive for your appointment. </li>
        <li>Bringing your children is not a good idea during this time, we would suggest only one person (the client requiring service) to enter the salon. </li>
        </ol>
        <br>

        <p><b>Be the change you want to see in the world.</b></p>
        <br>

        <p>This pandemic showed us how fickle our lives could be. Thus, we are doing as much as we can do make sure we don’t lose another loved one during these tough times. You might have a strong immune but your grandma, your next door neighbor or your favorite barista might not have as strong immune as you. Please be considerate towards everyone. You could not get affected but you could be a carrier and get someone else affected by it.</p> 
<br>

        <p><b>We greatly appreciate your support and consideration of our staff and fellow clients during this time! If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to us at <a href="tel:123-456-7890p123"> 123-456-789 </a>. We can't wait to see you!</b></p>
